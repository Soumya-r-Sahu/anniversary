# Music Queue - Anniversary Celebration

This directory contains playlist songs for the **anniversary celebration** experience.

## Used By:
- **`anniversary.html`** - Main anniversary celebration page

## How it works:
1. The main song (song1.m4a) plays first as background music
2. When the main song ends, the system automatically loads and plays songs from this queue directory
3. Songs are played in alphabetical order
4. After all queue songs finish, it loops back to the main song
5. The cycle continues indefinitely

## Supported formats:
- .m4a (recommended)
- .mp3
- .wav

## Adding songs:
1. Place your audio files in this directory
2. Name them with numbers or letters to control play order (e.g., 01-celebration-song.m4a, 02-anniversary-dance.m4a)
3. The system will automatically detect and play them

## Current queue:
- Empty (add your favorite celebration songs here!)

## Example structure:
```

├── 01-anniversary-celebration.m4a

```

The music controls (play/pause button) work the same way - they control the entire playlist system.
